Not all conflicts can be checked early, and not all that can be checked early are checked early at this point.Fixed a couple of bugs in the emitting of the test instruction -- it wouldn''t accept a nil size for the memory operand, and emitted opcode 85 even if it was a byte transfer due to checking the wrong operand for whether it was a byte register.' id 'a2fb604b-08c7-4476-a393-5bb0882223f1' date '27 January 2013' time '9:42:22.058 pm' author 'MartinMcClure' ancestors ((name 'AsmJit-x86-MartinMcClure.8' message 'Added two bits to the register code, to keep track of whether use of the register requires a REX prefix, or prohibits it, or can be used with or without a REX prefix.Added 8-bit registers SPL, BPL, SIL, DIL.Regularized #isX86, which was incorrectly answering false for MMX registers, and may have given incorrect answers for some XMM registers.A REX prefix of 0x40 can now be emitted, when it is required (only for registers SPL and so on).' id 'ba7e4cce-7cd6-406e-9da1-0f59f050cef7' date '27 January 2013' time '5:00:12.862 pm' author 'MartinMcClure' ancestors ((name 'AsmJit-x86-MartinMcClure.7' message 'Added the register names for the REX-enabled 8-bit registers SPL, BPL, SIL, DIL.
